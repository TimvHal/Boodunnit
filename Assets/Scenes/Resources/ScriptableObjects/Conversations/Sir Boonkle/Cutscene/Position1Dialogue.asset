  - Text: "So, you\u2019ve finally awakened."
  - Text: I almost started to petrify, and let me tell you, there are enough gravestones
      here as it is.
  - Text: "Then again, who am I to complain? I don\u2019t even remember what it feels
      like to have a body."
  - Text: "Sorry, I\u2019m not exactly known for my manners..."
  - Text: My name is Sir Bartholomeus Boonkle.
  - Text: Entrepreneur, hat fanatic and professional pipe smoker - in that order.
  - Text: "But you can just call me \u2018Mr. Boonkle\u2019 for short."
  - Text: "I take it you\u2019ve already had a little \u2018introduction\u2019 to
      this new life of yours,"
  - Text: "but I can imagine if you\u2019re still confused."
  - Text: Allow me to explain. And this might come as a shock to you, but...
  - Text: "You\u2019ve been murdered, Julia. The whole town\u2019s in an uproar about
      it."
  - Text: "Looks like you\u2019re already more popular than me, and I\u2019ve been
      here for almost 400 years..."
  - Text: "But we surely can\u2019t let your murder go around unsolved for that long,
      right?"
  - Text: "...Unless you\u2019ve already lost all hope, like I once did..."
  - Text: "Anyway\u2026 This \u2018unfinished business\u2019 of yours is why you
      can\u2019t rest in peace just yet,"
  - Text: " and that\u2019s where I come in."
  - Text: "I can\u2019t help you solve it, unfortunately,"
  - Text: but I can help you find and console your grieving sister, Emmie.
  - Text: "And you\u2019ll have to escape this cemetery to reach her."
  - Text: "I\u2019ll tell you more along the way."
  - Text: Now, shall we? You remember how to dash, correct?
  - Text: "Why don\u2019t you try it out on this fence right here?"
