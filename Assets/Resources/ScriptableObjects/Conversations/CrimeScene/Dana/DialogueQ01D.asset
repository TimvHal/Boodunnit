  - Text: "Oh\u2026 I see you found it. You\u2019re a really good detective!"
  - Text: "Yeah, this is one of mine. I\u2019m guessing you found where I threw it
      out, then."
  - Text: 'You know that I like to work in the bakery in my spare time, right? '
  - Text: "That\u2019s where your donut supply comes from. I\u2019m providing for
      you guys."
  - Text: Or, I guess, enabling your addictions.
  - Text: "But yeah. Anyway. I heard Julia\u2019s sister was coming to town soon."
  - Text: I wanted to welcome her with a surprise cake. I even made sure it was strawberry-flavoured.
  - Text: "According to Julia, that was Emmie\u2019s favourite."

      Her sister was murdered!"
  - Text: "Or are you asking me this\u2026 because you think this cake links me to
