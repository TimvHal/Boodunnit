  sentences:
  - Text: "Lawson, right? Yeah, I know her. It\u2019s an awful thing, what happened.
      Wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone."
  - Text: 'I remember when my mother died. It was terrible. '
  - Text: To make things worse, it was a hammer-related accident that got her.
  - Text: "Made me nervous around hammers for a while. In my line of profession,
      that\u2019s a career-killer."
  - Text: But, whenever I use my hammer, instead of getting sad, it reminds me of
      her instead.
  - Text: 'You helped me see that. '
  - Text: "But anyway, that\u2019s besides the point."
  - Text: "Sadly, I don\u2019t have a clue what happened. I was busy fixing the stairs
      in my house."
  - Text: "For some reason, they\u2019ve broken just so that you can only go downstairs,
      but not up again."
  - Text: "I haven\u2019t been able to shower or change in days, that\u2019s upstairs,
      sadly."
  - Text: Oh! Was that TMI? S-sorry!
