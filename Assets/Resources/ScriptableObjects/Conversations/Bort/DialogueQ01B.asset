  - Text: "We\u2019re, um, in the cemetery. Julia died yesterday."
  - Text: I miss her already. She was so great to talk to. Always down for a good
      prank.
  - Text: Remember the one with the catapult and the manure? That we shot at your
      house?
  - Text: Oh, that was unforgettable. I think we permanently lowered the property
      value.
  - Text: We did help clean it up though. All good pranksters have to walk the walk,
      as well.
  - Text: "But, you know\u2026 Julia\u2019s not with us anymore. "
