  - Text: Holy smoke out of my pipe, I think this place just closed.
  - Text: These walls are probably too thick for your dash.
  - Text: "I wish I could help you, but it looks like you\u2019ll have to find another

  - Text: Ugh... Disappointing others surely takes me back...
  - Text: Are all of these walls really as sturdy as they seem, though?
  - Text: "Oh, and in case you\u2019re wondering why you can\u2019t fly, or teleport..."
  - Text: "it took me half a century to master that. You simply can\u2019t because
      you\u2019re new to this form."
  - Text: Tough luck, ghostly novice!
